bio: Mirela completed her PhD studies in Molecular Biomedicine at Max Planck Institute in Münster, Germany, and her postdoc at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Having to deal with an ever increasing volume of biological data, she obtained her Master degree in Bioinformatics from Uppsala University in Sweden. 
Afterwards she worked as a Bioinformatician in the Bioinformatics Core Facility at Max Planck Institute in Freiburg, Germany. There she worked on various NGS projects, both on short and long reads, mainly focusing on epigenetic regulation. Her experience includes genome assembly, analyzing the correlation between prokaryotic genetic modifications and pathogenicity, and creating custom visualizations to facilitate informed decisions for theh projects. For her master thesis, she analysed transcriptomic data from non-human primates, vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 to detect the signaling pathways and networks that are responsible for the protection against the virus. 
Currently she is working in the Core Unit Bioinformatics (CUBI) at Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf with Dr. Peter Ebert, where she is creating bioinformatic pipelines to facilitate reproducible research.
