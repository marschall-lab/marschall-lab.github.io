We present a simple but powerful computational model of homologous allelic and
non-allelic recombination which leverages pangenome graphs, capable of
representing large structural variants including duplications, deletions and
inversions. We formulated and provided solutions for two founder set problems
under it and described exact methods for characterizing the number of
recombinations.
